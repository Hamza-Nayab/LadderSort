Cases todo:
Uniform random (baseline).
Already sorted (best-case stability/overhead).
Reverse sorted (classic worst case).
Nearly sorted (e.g., 5–10% local swaps or small Gaussian noise).
K-way interleaved runs (your “round-robin/sharded logs”; vary K to show 𝑂(𝑛log𝐾).
Riffled two sorted halves (random interleave of two runs).
Shuffled sorted blocks (few long presorted chunks; vary #blocks).
High-duplication / low-cardinality (e.g., values mod 1k) to stress partitioning/equality handling.
